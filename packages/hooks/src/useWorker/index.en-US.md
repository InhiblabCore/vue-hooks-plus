# useWorker

`useWorker` is a js library (with typescript support) that allows you to use the [Web Worker Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), through Vue Hook. This library allows you to run the expensive function without blocking the user interface, using a simple syntax that makes use of [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise?retiredLocale=it)

## Install

```bash

npm i @vue-hooks-plus/use-worker

```

### Auto Import

```typescript

import { VueHooksPlusUseWorkerResolver } from '@vue-hooks-plus/resolvers'

```
